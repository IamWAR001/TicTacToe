# TicTacToe

TicTacToe single screen application where you can alter the board size to be between 3x3 all the way to 10x10. 
You will play as a single player again a rudimentary AI that will play agains you with a response after 1 second.

Assumptions made here about ceiling of board size is to limit it to 10x10. Likely should have gone smaller, but playing a game of TicTacToe becomes drastically
user unfriendly past the 5x5 mark and strategy goes out the window. Add on top that the algorithmic complexity for the AI goes up based on dimensions.
